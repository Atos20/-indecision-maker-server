      "Before gameplay can begin, a dealer must be selected. Each player draws one card from a shuffled deck. The player with the lowest card becomes the dealer. The dealer shuffles the deck and passes out three cards to each player in a clockwise fashion. The remaining deck forms that stock and it is place in the middle of the play area. The top card of the stock is flipped over, placed beside it and becomes the discard pile.  The player to the left of the dealer begins gameplay. When it is their turn, players choose to either pick a card from the stock or from the discard pile and then they must discard one of their cards, all in an attempt to get a hand as close or equal to 31. Only cards of the same suit count as points. For example, if a player has an Aces of Spades, an 8 of Spades, and a King of Hearts, the player’s hand is worth 19. If a player has a three of a kind, the hand is worth 30 points. When a player is comfortable with their hand, they knock on the table. All other players then have one more draw to try and improve their hand. The player with the lowest hand loses for that round. If the player who knocks has the lowest hand, they give up a lost of 2 rather than 1. When a player loses 4 times, they are out of the game. The last player standing wins the game and, normally, a monetary prize made from the players’ contributions.",

For example, if the rank a player must lay down is a 5 and they have no 5s, they can secretly lay down a Queen and a Jack and say they are laying down two 5s. Before the next player lays down their cards, anyone who thinks the current player is lying can say “I Doubt It”.

      "Before gameplay can begin, a dealer must be selected. Each player draws one card from a shuffled deck. The player with the lowest card becomes the dealer. The dealer shuffles the deck and passes out all of the cards to each player in a clockwise fashion. Starting with the player to the left of the dealer and going clockwise, players take turns drawing the top card of their deck and placing it in a pile in the center of the group. Players can win all of the cards in the pile and advance in the game by two methods: Face Cards and Slapping. Face Cards: If a player draws a face card from their deck, the next player has a given number of chances to also draw a face card or else the pile goes to players on their right. A player’s number of chances to draw a face card depends on which face card was initially drawn. If an Ace was drawn, the next player has 4 chances. If a King was drawn, the next player has 3 chances. If a Queen was drawn, the next players has 2 chances. If a Jack was drawn, the next player has 1 chance. Slapping: The following card sequences allow any player to slap the pile and get all of the cards: Two cards of the same rank are played consecutively, The card played is the same rank as the first card of the pile, A combination of King and Queen are played consecutively,Two cards of the same rank have one different card in between them, The number value of the cards played adds up to 10, An ascending or descending run of four cards is played. Penalty: If you slap the pile when no sequences are in effect, you must add two cards to the bottom of the pile.",

      "Before game play can begin, a dealer must be selected. Each player draws one card from a shuffled deck. The player with the lowest card becomes the dealer. The dealer shuffles the deck and passes out cards clockwise for each player. If two people play, then each player receives 10 cards. For three or four players, each receives 7 cards. For five or six players, each receives 6 cards. The remaining cards are placed faced down in the center of the group to form the stock. The top card of the stock is flipped face up and placed next to the stock to form the discard pile. Play begins with the player to the left of the dealer. Every turn begins with the player selecting one card from either the stock or the discard pile. If at any point in the game the stock pile runs out, the discard pile is shuffled to form a new stock pile. The last card in the new stock pile becomes the first card in the discard pile. The general goal of the game is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. This can be done is three ways: Melding, Laying Off or Discarding. Melding: A player makes a meld by either having three or more of a kind or by having three or more of a run. A run is made of three or more cards of the same suit in increasing or decreasing order. When a player makes a meld they must lay it face up on the table. Melding is optional and you can only do it once a turn. Laying off: A player may also get rid of cards by building upon previously made melds. For instance, if a player has made a meld of 3 Kings and the player in play has the fourth King, they may place it on the 3 King meld to complete the set. Likewise, if a meld is made of the 2, 3, and 4 of clubs and the player in play has the Ace of clubs, they may place it before the 2 to build upon the run. Laying Off is optional and there is no limit to the number of Lay Offs you can make. Discarding: At the end of every turn, you must choose one card to add to the discard pile. Scoring: When one player gets rid of all of their cards, all players stop and tally up their points based on the remaining cards in their hand. Points are given by card value with Aces counting as 1 point and face cards counting as 10 points. The tallied points are given to the one who got rid of their cards first. Some can declare Rummy if they get rid of all of their cards in only one move. This can be done by opting out of making moves and strategically waiting for the right runs and melds to appear on the table. For the person who can declare Rummy, points are doubled.",

      "To set up a game of Palace, players need to form a circle around a stable playing area. Before gameplay can begin, every player must draw a card from a shuffled deck. The player with the highest card becomes the first dealer. Ties are broken by a redraw. The dealer then shuffles the deck and passes out nine cards to each player. The first three cards are faced down. The next three are placed faced up on top of the previous cards. The last three cards are the player’s hand and are placed faced up to the side of the other six. The remaining deck forms the Stock. Before the start, every player has the opportunity to exchange any of the cards in their hand with any of their three faced up cards. The player left of the dealer begins by placing a card in the center of the gameplay area. Going clockwise, players try to outrank or equal the previous card played with cards in their hand. If they cannot do so, they must take the entire center pile. A player must have three cards in their hand at all times. Players replace cards that they play with cards from the Stock. In Palace, 5s, 2s, and 10s are special cards. If a player plays a 5, the next card must be equal or lower in rank. 2s are wildcards. Any card can be played on top of a 2. 10s remove the pile. They also allow the same player to lead the next pile. After the Stock is exhausted and the player’s hand is empty, they move onto the three flipped over cards. After playing the three top cards, the player then blindly plays the three down facing cards. After flipping over a down facing card, they must play it before flipping over another card.

The dealer shuffles the deck and passes out all of the cards one by one to them and the other player. Players then alternately build up 5 stacks to form the tableau. With the first stack contains 1 card, the second stack contains 2 cards and so on until 5 stacks are made. The top cards are faced up while the others are faced down. The rest of the cards are kept by each player and form the spit pile. Players begin gameplay by each placing the top card of their spit pile onto the center of the playing table. Players then use the two piles to get rid of cards in their tableau. Players can get rid of cards if the card is up facing on their tableau and follows in increasing or decreasing sequence to the cards in the center. Players can also place cards on their own tableau piles as long as the cards follow in sequence. In Spit, Aces can be high and low so, they can be played against a King and a 2. Once a card is played, players will flip up the top card of the pile they just played from and continue in the game. There are no turns in Spit. Instead, players try to get rid of their tableau as soon as possible. If no player can play against any of the cards in the center, players play the top card in their spit pile. Once one of the players gets rid of their tableau, any player can quickly slap either of the two center piles. The first one to do so keeps the pile they slap while the other player gets the other pile. Because the objective is to ultimately get rid of all of your cards, players should try to slap the pile with the fewest cards. After a round, players will shuffle their cards and build a new tableau and continue playing. If both players do not have spit piles and neither can play on the center cards, the round is over and players try to slap the pile with the fewest cards. When a player cannot build a full tableau, their will only be one pile in the center. Gameplay continues until one player loses all of their cards.",

    instructions:
      "Before the game begins an initial dealer must be chosen. To do so, every player is given a card from a shuffled deck and whoever receives the highest card becomes the first dealer. Ties are broken by a repeated deal. The initial dealer shuffles the deck and the player to their right cuts it. The dealer then passes 11 cards one by one clockwise to each of the four players. The remaining cards are placed faced down to form the stock. The top card of the stock is turned upright and placed to the side to form the discard pile. The dealer position rotates clockwise at the end of each round. Teammates sit across from each other and work together to form more melds than the other team. Melding: Melds are formed by matching cards of the same rank. A meld must begin with at least three cards. Wildcards: The four Jokers and eight 2’s in the deck are wildcards and can be used to build upon any meld. Melds must have, however, more natural cards than wildcards in them. The gameplay moves clockwise from the dealer. At the beginning of their turn they must take a card from either the stock or the discard pile. To take a card from the discard pile, the top card must either help begin a meld or build upon one already made. If you take from the discard pile, you must take all of the cards in the discard pile. At the end of your turn, you must discard one card. Players continue to build upon melds in hopes to get a canasta, a meld of seven or more cards. Once a team has at lease one canasta and one of the players runs out of their cards, they can “go out” and end the round. Points are given in 4 ways: Card Values, Canastas, Red 3’s, and Going Out. In Canasta, Jokers are worth 50 points, Aces and 2’s are worth 20 points, Kings through 8’s are worth 10 points and 7’s through 4’s and black 3’s are worth 5 points. Points are given from the difference between melded cards and unmelded cards. A canasta without any wildcards is worth an additional 500 points while a canasta with wildcards is worth an additional 300 points. Each red 3 is worth 100 points. If a team has all of the red 3’s, however, they receive 800 points. The team that goes out and ends the round receives an additional 100 points. If a player has a red 3 in their hand, they must immediately place it on the table along with the melds. The first meld a player makes must have a minimum meld value depending on the team’s current score. For a team score of 0-1499, the first meld of a player must be at least 50 points. For a team score of 1500-2999, the first meld of a player must be at least 90 points. For a team score of 3000+, the first meld of a player must be at least 120 points. The discard pile can become frozen (i.e. nobody can take from it) if a player decides to discard a wildcard. The discard pile can become unfrozen if a player can make a natural meld with the top card in the pile.",

Cards can overlap as long as you can see what cards are underneath the top cards, this is a major difference between Freecell solitaire and Klondike solitaire, and what makes this variant easier. Choose where you will have space for 4 cards as a temporary holding place during the game (free cells). Determine where you will create 4 stacks of ascending cards to begin with the Aces of each suit to the King – the foundation row.   Finally, a row of eight cards is dealt face up to start the tableau and continuing to deal the remaining cards to have a final tableau with 4 rows with 7 cards and 4 rows with 6 cards. Look for the Aces of the 4 suits. Try to move the Aces to the foundation row as soon as possible. Play cards between each column by creating lines of cards in descending order, alternating colors between black and red cards. For example, you can place a red Nine of hearts on a black Ten of spades. Place a card(s) into the ‘free cell’ (4 spaces to temporarily hold a card), this will give you access to cards in the columns and allows you to move in the columns to get to the Aces. Look for the lower numbers of each suit and move cards to gain access to the lower numbers. Move cards to the foundation piles as soon as possible. Try to increase the foundations evenly so you have cards to use in the columns. As you put more cards in the free cells, the number of cards you can move decreases. For instance, if you don’t have any cards in the free cells, you can move up to four cards. If you have one card in the free cells, you can only move three cards, and so on. You win the game when you have 4 foundations with cards in ascending order from Ace to King in each suit.",
